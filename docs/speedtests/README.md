## Test methods

Originally I used speedtest.net in the RPi4 browser but will be switching
 to command line like this.

```
~/Pilot $ speedtest-cli
Retrieving speedtest.net configuration...
Testing from Three (94.196.182.81)...
Retrieving speedtest.net server list...
Selecting best server based on ping...
Hosted by Redraw Internet (London) [2.56 km]: 64.756 ms
Testing download speed................................................................................
Download: 5.17 Mbit/s
Testing upload speed......................................................................................................
Upload: 2.09 Mbit/s
```

Install speedtest-cli
```
sudo apt install speedtest-cli
```

Note the speedtest-cli is written in Python so probably can be modified
 or repurposed for automated testing


## 02 PAYG SIM testing
With a new PAYG SIM the modem could not IP connect.  
After a £10 top up - still no connection  
After £20 the 5GB contracted started and it worked  
Disconnecting / reconnecting the antenna caused a massive 
 delay before the modem could reconnect
