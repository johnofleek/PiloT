The real [repository](https://github.com/johnofleek/Pilot/tree/master/scripts_pilotControl) folder contains shell script files which enable the RPi to control the power state of the PiloT board  

Including this [note](https://github.com/johnofleek/PiloT/tree/master/scripts_pilotControl/controlUsing_gpiod.md) which discusses functionality bundled with the Bullseye based Raspberry Pi OS. Maybe useful as the older scripts are based in wiringpi which is becoming obsolete
